//To find the LCM, we can follow these steps:
//
//Prime factorize each number in the given set.
//Take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers.
//Multiply all the prime factors raised to their highest power together.
//Let's go through the calculation step by step:
//
//Prime factorization of each number:
//
//1: Prime factorization is 1.
//2: Prime factorization is 2.
//3: Prime factorization is 3.
//4: Prime factorization is 2^2.
//5: Prime factorization is 5.
//6: Prime factorization is 2 x 3.
//7: Prime factorization is 7.
//8: Prime factorization is 2^3.
//9: Prime factorization is 3^2.
//10: Prime factorization is 2 x 5.
//Take the highest power of each prime factor:
//
//Prime factor 2 appears with the highest power of 3 (2^3).
//Prime factor 3 appears with the highest power of 2 (3^2).
//Prime factor 5 appears with the highest power of 1.
//Prime factor 7 appears with the highest power of 1.
//Multiply all the prime factors raised to their highest power together:
//LCM = 2^3 x 3^2 x 5 x 7 = 8 x 9 x 5 x 7 = 2520.
